# fileicon &mdash; introduction

`fileicon` is an OSX CLI for managing custom icons for files and folders, as 
a programmatic alternative to interactively using Finder.

`fileicon` allows assigning a custom icon to any file or folder,
using any image file whose format is recognized by the system.

_Caveat_: Custom icons rely on [extended attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#OS_X) of OSX' filesystem, [HFS+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus);
therefore, custom icons are lost when copying files or folders to filesystems that don't
support these attributes; for instance, custom icons cannot be stored in a Git repository.

# Examples

```sh
# Assign custom icon derived from image file 'img.png' to file 'foo':
fileicon set foo img.png

# Remove previously assigned custom icon from folder 'foodir':
fileicon rm foodir

# Extract custom icon from file 'foo' to icon file 'foo.icns':
fileicon get foo

# Test if folder 'foodir' has custom icon:
fileicon test foodir
```

# Installation

**Supported platforms**

* **OSX**

## Installation from the npm registry

With [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js](https://iojs.org/) installed, install [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fileicon) as follows:

    [sudo] npm install fileicon -g

**Note**:

* Whether you need `sudo` depends on how you installed Node.js / io.js and whether you've [changed permissions later](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions); if you get an `EACCES` error, try again with `sudo`.
* The `-g` ensures [_global_ installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally) and is needed to put `fileicon` in your system's `$PATH`.

## Manual installation

* Download [the CLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mklement0/fileicon/stable/bin/fileicon) as `fileicon`.
* Make it executable with `chmod +x fileicon`.
* Move it or symlink it to a folder in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin` (requires `sudo`).

# Usage

Find concise usage information below; for complete documentation, read the [manual online](doc/fileicon.md), or, once installed, run `man fileicon` (`fileicon --man` if installed manually).

<!-- DO NOT EDIT THE FENCED CODE BLOCK and RETAIN THIS COMMENT: The fenced code block below is updated by `make update-readme/release` with CLI usage information. -->

REMOVE a custom icon from a file or folder:

    fileicon rm       <fileOrFolder>

GET a file or folder's custom icon:

    fileicon get [-f] <fileOrFolder> [<iconOutputFile>]

    -f ... force replacement of existing output file
