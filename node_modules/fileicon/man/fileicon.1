.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fB<fileOrFolder>\fP is the file or folder whose custom icon should be managed\.
.br
Note that symlinks are followed to their (ultimate target); that is, you
.br
can only assign custom icons to regular files and folders, not to symlinks
.br
to them\.
.P
\fB<imageFile>\fP can be an image file of any format supported by the system\.
.br
It is converted to an icon and assigned to \fB<fileOrFolder>\fP\|\.
.P
\fB<iconOutputFile>\fP specifies the file to extract the custom icon to:
.br
Defaults to the filename of \fB<fileOrFolder>\fP with extension \fB\|\.icns\fP appended\.
.br
If a value is specified, extension \fB\|\.icns\fP is appended, unless already present\.
.br
Either way, extraction fails if the target file already exists; use \fB\-f\fP to
.br
override\.
.br
Specify \fB\-\fP to extract to stdout\.  
.P
Command \fBtest\fP signals with its exit code whether a custom icon is set (0)
.br
or not (1); any other exit code signals an unexpected error\.

.br
When getting (extracting) a custom icon, forces replacement of the
.br
output file, if it already exists\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP
.br
Suppresses output of the status information that is by default output to
.br
stdout\.
.br
Note that errors and warnings are still printed to stderr\.

.RE
.SH NOTES
.P
Custom icons are stored in extended attributes of the HFS+ filesystem\.
.br
Thus, if you copy files or folders to a different filesystem that doesn't
.br
support such attributes, custom icons are lost; for instance, custom icons
.br
cannot be stored in a Git repository\.
.P
To determine if a give file or folder has extended attributes, use
.br
\fBls \-l@ <fileOrFolder>\fP\|\.
.P
When setting a custom icon, the source image is resized to 128 x 128 pixels
.br
and stored as a single icon, which the system resizes dynamically, depending
.br
on context\.
.br
Currently, even if the source image file is itself an \fB\|\.icns\fP file that
.br
contains multiple icons with distinct resolutions, only the 128 x 128 icon
.br
is assigned\.
